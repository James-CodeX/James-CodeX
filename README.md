# **Hi, I’m James! 👋**  
### **⚡ Electronics & Computer Engineering Student | Code + Circuits = Magic**  

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m the kind of person who gets excited when a LED blinks for the first time or when my code finally compiles without errors. I’m on a mission to make the world smarter, one byte (and wire) at a time.

## **What I Do**  
- **🔧 Build Stuff:** From embedded systems to IoT gadgets, I love creating things that blink, beep, and talk to the cloud.  
- **💻 Write Code:** C/C++, Python, and whatever language the project demands (yes, even Assembly if I’m feeling brave).  
- **🤖 Automate Life:** Why do things manually when you can write a script to do it for you?

## **My Projects**  
Here are some things I’ve built (or attempted to build):  
- **🌐 IoT Weather Station:** Because I like knowing if it’s raining without looking out the window.  
- **🤖 Line-Following Robot:** It’s like a Roomba, but way less useful.  
- **💡 Smart Home System:** My lights now turn on when I clap. My neighbors hate me.

## **Fun Facts About Me**  
- I can debug code and circuits at the same time (multitasking level: expert).  
- I speak both binary and sarcasm fluently.  
- My idea of a good time is soldering at 2 AM.

## **Current Obsessions**  
- **🤔 RTOS:** Because who doesn’t love real-time chaos?  
- **🧠 Machine Learning:** Teaching machines to think so I don’t have to.  
- **🔌 FPGA Programming:** Turning hardware into software and confusing everyone in the process.
