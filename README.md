## 👋 Hey there! I'm James

I'm a curious developer, engineering student, and self-taught graphics designer who loves bringing ideas to life—whether that’s through code, visuals, or both. From building full-stack web apps to sketching out designs in Figma, I’m all about creativity backed by solid logic.

### 🎨 Design Meets Code
I'm not a pro designer (yet), but I love playing around with layout, color, and typography—especially when it makes the user experience smoother and more beautiful. You'll usually find me balancing code with a touch of Figma or Photoshop.

- **Frontend**: react, HTML/CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Firebase, Supabase, convex
- **Design**: Figma, Photoshop, Canva, Adobe Illustrator

### 📚 Forever Learning
I’m deep into Iot development, AI, Engineering—you know, the fun stuff. Always leveling up both technically and creatively.
